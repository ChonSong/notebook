            "# Comprehensive Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning Models\\n",
            "\\n",
            "This notebook provides a complete implementation of sentiment analysis using various deep learning architectures including RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers. The implementations are based on insights from key research papers in the field.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "## Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation\\n",
            "\\n",
            "This implementation draws from five seminal papers in deep learning for natural language processing:\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 1. \\\"Attention Is All You Need\\\" by Vaswani et al. (2017)\\n",
            "This groundbreaking paper introduced the Transformer architecture, revolutionizing NLP by using self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrent structures. The key insight is that self-attention allows models to directly access any position in the sequence, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs or LSTMs. We implement this architecture with positional encodings and multi-head attention for our sentiment classification task.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 2. \\\"Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging\\\" by Huang, Xu, and Yu (2015)\\n",
            "This paper validates the importance of bidirectional processing for sequence understanding. By processing sequences both forward and backward, Bi-LSTMs capture richer contextual information. This is particularly important for sentiment analysis where context from both directions affects meaning (e.g., \\\"The movie was not bad at all\\\"). We implement bidirectional variants of our RNN, LSTM, and GRU models.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 3. \\\"A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding\\\" by Lin et al. (2017)\\n",
            "This paper introduces self-attention for creating interpretable sentence embeddings, moving beyond simple last-hidden-state approaches. The attention mechanism creates weighted combinations of hidden states, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant words for classification. We implement attention-based variants of our sequence models using this approach.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 4. \\\"GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation\\\" by Pennington, Socher, and Manning (2014)\\n",
            "This paper demonstrates the power of pre-trained word embeddings that capture semantic relationships through global co-occurrence statistics. While we start with randomly initialized embeddings in this notebook, the GloVe paper provides the theoretical foundation for why pre-trained embeddings are so effective and could be integrated as a future enhancement.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 5. \\\"Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification\\\" by Joulin et al. (2016)\\n",
            "This FastText paper shows that simple models can be surprisingly effective, serving as an important baseline. It highlights the value of n-gram features and efficient training. While we focus on more complex models, this paper reminds us to evaluate whether the complexity is justified by performance gains.\\n",
