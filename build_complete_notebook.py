            "**Application**: We implement the Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention and positional encodings. The paper's key insight about self-attention allowing direct access to any sequence position guides our implementation of the TransformerModel class, enabling better long-range dependency modeling than RNNs.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 2. \\\"Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging\\\" by Huang, Xu, and Yu (2015)\\n",
            "**Application**: This paper validates our implementation of bidirectional variants (BidirectionalLSTMModel, BidirectionalGRUModel). The forward and backward processing captures richer context, crucial for sentiment analysis where future words can change meaning (e.g., \\\"The movie was not bad at all\\\").\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 3. \\\"A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding\\\" by Lin et al. (2017)\\n",
            "**Application**: Our attention-enhanced models (LSTMWithAttentionModel, GRUWithAttentionModel) implement this paper's approach of using attention weights over all hidden states instead of just the final output, creating more informative sentence representations.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 4. \\\"GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation\\\" by Pennington, Socher, and Manning (2014)\\n",
            "**Application**: While we use randomly initialized embeddings for self-containment, this paper provides the theoretical foundation for why pre-trained embeddings capture semantic relationships through global co-occurrence statistics.\\n",
            "\\n",
            "### 5. \\\"Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification\\\" by Joulin et al. (2016)\\n",
            "**Application**: This FastText paper reminds us that simple models can be effective baselines. Our simple tokenization and the inclusion of basic models serve as sanity checks against more complex architectures.\\n"
